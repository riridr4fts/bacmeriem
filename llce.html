            <h2>1. Affiche du film *12 Angry Men* üé¨</h2>
            <p>12 Angry Men is a movie about a jury of twelve men deciding whether a young guy is guilty of murder or not. The film dives deep into things like prejudice, racism, and how easily people can make decisions based on their biases. It became controversial because it made people realize how unfair the justice system can be, especially when it comes to race. Even though the movie was meant to make people think about these issues, it also sparked debates about the flaws in society. The controversy came from how the film made viewers question the way juries work and whether people are really judging cases fairly, or just based on their own personal beliefs.</p>

            <h2>2. Po√®me d‚ÄôE.E. Cummings üìú</h2>
            <p>E.E. Cummings was known for doing poetry totally differently from anyone else. His poems didn‚Äôt follow normal rules for punctuation or grammar, and he used weird capitalizations and line breaks. At first, his style was shocking and a lot of people didn‚Äôt understand it. But as time went on, people started to realize how cool and creative it was. His poems were controversial because they broke all the rules of what poetry was supposed to be. But now, they‚Äôre appreciated for how they challenged the norm and pushed the boundaries of what poetry could be. It shows how art can seem weird or controversial at first, but later on, it can be recognized as innovative.</p>

            <h2>3. Article de *The Guardian* sur Amy Winehouse üé§</h2>
            <p>The article from The Guardian talks about how the media and the public focused way more on Amy Winehouse‚Äôs personal problems than her music. She was an amazing singer and songwriter, but instead of celebrating her talent, people were obsessed with her struggles with addiction and her messy personal life. The controversy around her wasn‚Äôt just about her music, but about how everyone reacted to her downfall. This turned Amy into a symbol of both talent and tragedy. The article points out how the media often shifts the focus from an artist‚Äôs work to their drama, especially when it‚Äôs more ‚Äúexciting‚Äù for the public to follow. It shows how artists sometimes have no control over how they‚Äôre seen, and how society can create its own narrative about them, turning them into controversial figures even when that wasn‚Äôt their intention.</p>

            <h2>4. Photo de Lady Gaga en robe de viande üçñ</h2>
            <p>Lady Gaga‚Äôs meat dress, worn at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, is one of the most famous examples of art used to intentionally provoke a reaction. The dress, made entirely of raw meat, was designed to make a bold statement about animal rights and the way society treats both animals and women. By wearing something that many saw as grotesque, Gaga sought to shock the public and force them to confront uncomfortable issues about exploitation and societal values. The dress was controversial because it challenged the boundaries of fashion and art, as well as the expectations placed on female celebrities. It sparked debates about whether art should be used to challenge norms and whether public figures should use their platform to address difficult topics in such an extreme way.</p>

            <h2>5. Peinture *Myra* de Marcus Harvey üé®</h2>
            <p>Marcus Harvey‚Äôs painting Myra also uses shock value to provoke controversy, but this time, the subject is a notorious criminal, Myra Hindley, who was convicted of the murder of children in the 1960s. Harvey‚Äôs choice to paint Hindley‚Äôs portrait using children‚Äôs handprints added another layer of discomfort, as it seemed to implicate the public in the creation of the artwork. The painting was controversial because it forced people to reckon with a figure that many found morally repulsive. The use of handprints, symbolizing innocence, juxtaposed with the violent nature of the crime, created a powerful image that divided opinion. The painting sparked debates about whether it was appropriate to create art about criminals, whether this could be seen as glorifying or trivializing their crimes, and how society should deal with the representation of such figures in art. It also raised questions about the role of art in confronting uncomfortable truths.</p>

                <p><strong>I) Art can be intentionally controversial to provoke a reaction</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Lady Gaga (Meat Dress)</strong>: Lady Gaga deliberately used controversy to draw attention to social issues such as animal rights and the objectification of women. Her art was intentionally designed to provoke strong reactions from her audience, sparking important discussions.

                <p>
                    <strong>Marcus Harvey (Myra)</strong>: Similarly, Marcus Harvey‚Äôs painting Myra of Myra Hindley, the notorious British criminal, wasn‚Äôt just meant to shock but to encourage reflection on crime and the way society remembers its criminals. In both cases, the artists used controversy as a tool to challenge societal norms and provoke deeper thinking about broader issues.

                <p><strong>II) Art becomes controversial despite the artist‚Äôs intentions</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Amy Winehouse (The Guardian article)</strong>: On the other hand, art can become controversial despite an artist‚Äôs intentions. Amy Winehouse, for example, didn‚Äôt aim for her life and music to become a media spectacle. Her personal struggles, however, became the focus of the media, overshadowing her artistic work. This unintended controversy highlights how external factors, such as media portrayal, can influence the public‚Äôs reception of an artist.

                <p>
                    <strong>12 Angry Men (Film)</strong>: Similarly, the film 12 Angry Men wasn‚Äôt designed to be controversial, but its themes of prejudice and justice sparked debates about racism and societal bias. The filmmakers didn‚Äôt plan for the controversy, but the societal sensitivity to these issues made the film controversial over time.

                <p><strong>III) Interpretation and reception of art evolve after time</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <strong>E.E. Cummings (Poetry)</strong>: In the case of E.E. Cummings, his unconventional poetry initially shocked audiences, but over time it was recognized as innovative and highly influential in the world of literature. His works, which broke traditional poetic forms, initially caused controversy but eventually became celebrated as a significant contribution to poetry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Link to Plan</strong>: The initial shock and controversy surrounding Cummings' work faded as his unique style was appreciated and acknowledged for its impact on the development of poetry, showing how the interpretation of art can evolve over time and become more appreciated as society changes.
